## Adding the EMB Global Logo

To display the EMB Global logo in the application:

1. **Save the logo image** (the green flower/leaf design) as: `emb_global_logo.png` in this directory

2. **File requirements**:
   - Format: PNG (preferred) or JPG
   - Transparent background recommended
   - Recommended width: 280 pixels (as specified in CSS)
   - High resolution for clarity
   - The logo should be the exact EMB Global flower/leaf design provided

3. **File path should be**:
   ```
   /Users/arushigupta/Desktop/EMB/Demos/NLP to SQL/assets/emb_global_logo.png
   ```

4. **Restart the application** after adding the logo:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The logo will automatically appear at the top of the application with a thin divider line below it.
